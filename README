This is an extended/altered -- and experimental (!) -- version of the read activity. 
Annotations currently work only for texts downloaded with the GetBooks activity, as the texts are identified by their URL.

Features:
 - add multiple annotations per page
 - sync annotations with a web server
 - download annotations of other people for the same text (identified by its url)
